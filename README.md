### What I learned

In this project I have learned how to use media query to make my design responsive for different screen widths.

### Useful resources

- [Master Media Queries And Responsive CSS Web Design Like a Chameleon!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K24lUqcT0Ms) - This helped me get started with using media queries to make my website responsive to different screen widths. Slaying The Dragon carefully explained when a web page should apply media queries to make the content fit best.
